# Hackathon-For-Social-Good
Repo containing the deliverables for Hackathon for Social Good (April 22- June 12 2020)

## Introduction 
Due to Covid19, various social distancing measures like travel bans & WFH policies were adopted. This has forced people out of public spaces and a lot of conversation moved online to social networks like Twitter, FB Groups, Reddit etc.

We will use these discussions to visualize the social discourse during these dire times!
